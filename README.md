# LLDB: 42-rush

A debugger is software that helps a developer analyze program bugs. To do this, it makes it possible to execute the program step-by-step, display the value of the variables at any time, set up breakpoints on conditions or on program lines... This rush is simply to help you discover methods that can be used by a debugger to detect bugs on your programs in general. Once this rush is over, the use of lldb specifically will no longer have any secrets for you.
